## How Dit It All Start
- Shift from on-premise software model to a subscription based software - as-a-service modle
- Shifted from Product Era (manufacturing era) focused on supply chain to Service Era

Product Era | Service Era
------------|-------------
Demand exceeds supply | Supply exceeds deman
Focus on supply chaing | focus on the customer
Six sigma | User Experience design
Internet changes everything | Cloud + Mobile changes everything
Systems of record | Systemes of Engagement
SAP, Oracle, Cisco, Microsoft Intel | SalesForce, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft
B2B enables B2c | B2C enables B2B
Customer support | customer success

- This is the Macro shift
- The shift is driven by the cost keeping the software up and running
- On-premise software license 9% vs Cloud Computing Software licenses 68%.  New delivery model shift the balance to customer
- This shift is effecting all industries as they are all technology driven.  Buyers expect easier and more personalized buying experience.  Companies are trying to shift subscription
- Moving from consumer to subscription.  The age of the subscriber.  How do we keep the subscriber?

### Subscription Economy
- Easier barriers to entry and exit.  Easier to jump to another solution
- Companies moving from thinking of their customers as consumers to subscribers
- Satisfaction is as important as price (value).  Subcriptions end.
- Initial Sales is 5 to 30% of revenue with 70-95% of revenues come from renewals and upsells
- Burden of success shifts to seller.  The are floating the cost of expense of acquiring and keeping a customer
- Now focus on customer success

### Simple SaaS Econmics
- $18 to acquire a new customer (CAC - Cost of Acquistion)
- $1 in profit/month from that customer
- You don't recoup CAC until month 18.  Most companies try to break even in the 12 ~ 15 month range
- If customer leaves after 12 months, you incur a loss

Churn Destoys SaaS Business - customers leaving the business too soon.  In 2005 Salesforce was losing 8% of customers a month.  Essentially 100% customer turned over each year.  This was the birth of Customer Success

### Five Hallmarks of Customer Success
- Focus on Customer Engagement - Don't think about just the product.  How do customers interact with product.  What's the value they get from the product.  How are you engaging with the customer
- Create organizational alignment to deliver customer outcomes.  Everyone in the company focused on customer outcomes
- Develop a common language so everyone in the company understand what they were talking about and creating measurements and metrics
- Learn from Churn.  Analyze root causes of churn.
- Create an Early Warning System.  Gather data from customers doing both well and poorly to predict possible churn. Risk Identification, Customer Success Score, etc.
