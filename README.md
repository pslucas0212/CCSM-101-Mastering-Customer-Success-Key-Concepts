## How Dit It All Start
- Shift from on-premise software model to a subscription based software - as-a-service modle
- Shifted from Product Era (manufacturing era) focused on supply chain to Service Era

Product Era | Service Era

Demand exceeds supply | Supply exceeds deman
Focus on supply chaing | focus on the customer
Six sigma | User Experience design
Internet changes everything | Cloud + Mobile changes everything
Systems of record | Systemes of Engagement
SAP, Oracle, Cisco, Microsoft Intel | SalesForce, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft
B2B enables B2c | B2C enables B2B
Customer support | customer success

- This is the Macro shift
- The shift is driven by the cost keeping the software up and running
- On-premise software license 9% vs Cloud Computing Software licenses 68%.  New delivery model shift the balance to customer
- This shift is effecting all industries as they are all technology driven.  Buyers expect easier and more personalized buying experience.  Companies are trying to shift subscription
- Moving from consumer to subscription.  The age of the subscriber.  How do we keep the subscriber?

### Subscription Economy
- Easier barriers to entry and exit.  Easier to jump to another solution
- Companies moving from thinking of their customers as consumers to subscribers
- Satisfaction is as important as price (value).  Subcriptions end.
- Initial Sales is 5 to 30% of revenue with 70-95% of revenues come from renewals and upsells
- Burden of success shifts to seller

### Simple SaaS Econmics
- $18 to acquire a new customer (CAC - Cost of Acquistion)
- $1 in profit/month from that customer
- You don't recoup CAC until month 18
- If customer leaves after 12 months, you incur a loss
